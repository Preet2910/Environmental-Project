            <h2>What is Climate Resilience ? </h2>
            <p>Climate resilience is the ability to anticipate, prepare for, and respond to climate-related events, trends, or disturbances. It involves proactive measures to adapt to changing conditions, enhance preparedness, and reduce vulnerability. Climate resilience encompasses strategies such as sustainable infrastructure development, ecosystem restoration, and community engagement.</p>
            <h3>It involves : </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Assessing how climate change will create new or alter current climate-related risks.</li>
                <li>Taking steps to better cope with these risks</li>
                <li>Recovering from or mitigating vulnerability to climate-related shocks such as floods and droughts</li>
                <li>Successfully coping with and managing the impacts of climate change while preventing those impacts from growing worse</li>
                <li>Incurring minimal damage to societal wellbeing, the economy, and the environment</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Why Climate Resilience ?</h2>
        <div id="intro">
            <div class="intro-txt">
            <p>In light of our changing environment, climate resilience is vitally important. 
                Unthinkable changes in global weather patterns, temperature increases, and an increase 
                in the frequency and severity of extreme occurrences are being witnessed by people. 
                The ecosystems, communities, and economies are all seriously threatened by these changes. 
                Climate resilience is a proactive and planned strategy to increasing societies' ability to 
                resist, adjust to, and recover from the negative effects of climate change. It goes beyond 
                merely responding to these issues. By making investments in climate resilience, we protect 
                vulnerable ecosystems and populations while also ensuring the planet's long-term sustainability 
                and well-being. It involves implementing creative approaches, sustainable practices, and community
                involvement to build a future where we will be more capable of navigating the uncertainties of climate change.
