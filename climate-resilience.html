            <li>Coastal Flooding</li>
            <p>Coastal flooding is a suddem and abrupt inundation of a coastal enviorment caused by a short-term increase in water level due to storm surge and extreme time. It's magnitude and extension depends on the coastal topography, storms conditions.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Resilient Methods</li>
            <ul>
                <li>We can build resilient infrastructure , such as elevated structuure on pillars with bouyant tanks to rise during flood</li>
                <li>The restoration of coastal ecosystem to act as natural barriers against storm surges.</li>
                <li>We can also use early warniing system and community emergency preparedness.</li>

            <li>Sea level rise</li>
            <p>Sea level rise is caused primarily by two factors related to globa warming: the added water from melting ice sheets and glaciers, and the expansion of seawater as it warms. Melting glaciers and thermal expansion of sea water due to global warming which lead to sea level rise.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Resilient Methods</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Seawall levels and other coastal defense can be constructed to protect against rising tides.</li>
                <li>Coastal retreat stratigies can be implemented to move vulnerable structure away from the shorelines.</li>
                <li>Toreduce vulnerability to sea level rise, we can use and plan proper sustainable land use.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Wildfires</li>
            <p>High atmospheric temperature, proloonged droughts, dryness and dry vegetation can lead to increased wild fire risks. In addition to that, human activities such as leaving a campfire unattended, discarding lit cigrattes, are among the causes of wildfires.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Resilient Methods</li>
            <ul>
                <li>We can reduce fuel load by implementing controlled burns and other forest management techniques.</li>
                <li>We can create defensible spaces around buildings and also we can use fire resistant building materials.</li>
                <li>We can use developing early warning system and spread public education on fire safety.</li>
                <li>Use composition metals or tile instead of wood or stingle roof. Cover vent and chimney opening with metal mesh.</li>

            <li>Cyclones and Strong winds</li>
            <p>Cyclones and Strong winds are caused by atmospheric disturbances around a low-pressure area distinguished by swift and often destructive air circulation. Cyclones are usually accompanied by violent storms and bad weathers. It is caused by increased frequency and intensity of cyclone due to warmer sea surface temperatures.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Resilient Methods</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Designing Building with aerodynamics stapes and optimal wind-resistant orientation.</li>
                <li>We can use strong and flexible building materials and modern construction techniques.</li>
                <li>Robust foundation-to-roof connections can be designed to withstand strong winds.</li>

            <li>Heat Waves</li>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>High pressure system: </li>
                    <p>Heat waves often result from the presence of high presuure system that causes air to descend and supress cloud formation. The descending warms adiabatically, leading to temperature increase at the surface.</p>
                    <li>Persistent Weather Pattern:</li>
                    <p>Certain atmospheric patterns, such as blocking patterns, can lead to the stagnation of weather patterns and system. When high pressure system remains stationary for an extended period, they can trap hot air and prevent dissipiation of heat.</p>
                    <li>Subsidence:</li>
                    <p>Subsidence occurs when air depends on the atmosphere. As it descends it get compressed and warms, creating a stable layer of warm air near the surface. This inhibits vertical mixing and prevents the dispersion of heat.</p>
                    <li>Lack of cloud Cover</li>
                    <p>Clear skies allow the sun rays to reach earth surface directly, leading to increased heating. Absence of cloud cover reduces albedo effect which reflects some of the sunlight back to space.</p>
                    <li>Climate change:</li>
                    <p>Long term change in climate patterns, attributed to human induced climate change, can influence the frequency and intensity of heat waves. Fixing global temperature contribute to more extreme and prolonged periods of heat.</p>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Resilient Methods</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Planting urban forest and green spaces to provide shade and cool the enviorment.</li>
                <li>Incorporating sustainable urban design principle to reduce heat absorption and retention</li>
                <li>Implementing building design that enhances natural ventilation and reduce the need for air conditioning.</li>

                    <li>Water erosion: </li>
                    <p>It is caused by rainfall and surface runoff, leading the detachment and transportation of soil particles.</p>
                    <li>Wind erosion:</li>
                    <p>Wind can carry away loose, dry soil particles, especially in arid and exposed area.</p>
                    <li>Gravity erosion:</li>
                    <p>Slope instability and gravitational force can cause soil to move downhill, especially in steep terrains</p>
                    <li>Deforestation</li>
                    <p>Removal of vegitation reduces the protective cover making soil more vulnerable to erosion.</p>
                    <li>Overgrazing:</li>
                    <p>Excessive grazing by livestock can remove vegetation, exposing soil to erosion.</p>
                    <li>Agriculture practices:</li>
                    <p>Poor farming techniques like and impeloper plowing, mono cropping, overuse of irrigation Contribute to soil erosion.</p>
                    <li>Mining activities</li>
                    <p> Extractive industries can disturb soil layers making them suspectible to erosion.</p>
                    <li>Construction and urbanization:</li>
                    <p>Cleaning land for infrastructure and urban development disturbs natural soil stability.</p>
                </ul>
            </p>

                    <li>Lack of Precipitation:</li>
                    <p>Insufficient rainfall or snow over extended periods  primary natural cause of drought. Changes in regional patterns, Such as El Niño events or la Niña events can influence precipitation level.</p>
                    <li>High Temperature:</li>
                    <p>Elevated temperatures Contributes to increased evapouration and transpiration, leading to higher weather loss from soil and Vegetation. Prolonged periods of high temperature can increase drought conditions.</p>
                    <li>Soil moisture depletion:</li>
                    <p>Continous high temperature and lack of precipitation can quickly deplete soil moisture Crops rely on soil moisture for growth.</p>

                    <p>Excessive pumping of ground-water for agriculture, industry and over domestic use can lead to lowered aquifires, contributing to drought conditions.</p>
                    <li>Natural Variability:</li>
                    <p>Climate system naturally exhibit varibality leading to periods of drought as part of the earth's cyclic patterns.</p>
